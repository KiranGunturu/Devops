terraform plan - dry to run to check what happens when we run terraform apply command like with what options instance is going to create 
terraform apply - to create the resources on the cloud provider like ec2

AMI ID - to locate this - go to ec2 - launch instance and select anyone like macOS, ubuntu, amazon linux and that will show us an AMI
